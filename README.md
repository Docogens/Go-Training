# Go-Training
Lecture Notes

Getting started with Go

Creation of Go:
* Simplicity
* Safety
* Readability

Go Programming supports:
* Procedural
* Concurrent
* Distrbuted

Web Development with Go:
* Web services
	* Microservice architectures
	* Web applications
	* Go includes a simple web server for testing & debugging

Go uses static linking:
* Go compiler makes a copy of all library functions that are used in the executable file.
	* Consequently, static linking creates 
		* larger binary files a little larger 
		* and does consume more memory

	â€¢ Enables any binaries generated by Go to easily be transferable to other systems with the same OS

Go supports Unicode:
* Out of the box
* Supporting both character sets & multiple human languages

Go is Orthogonal:
* Orthogonality meaning operations change one thing and only one thing
	* Don't have an effect on anything else
* Technical side effects do not propagate through components of a system
* Experience has shown that systems with a smaller number of orthogonal features are much better than those having several overlapping features


Pros of Go:
* Standardy Library
	* Cryptography
	* Byte Manipulation
	* I/O management 
	* JSON support
	* Web server
 * Interface types
	* Decouple dependencies
	* Write modular and testable code
	* Create flexible and scalable code
* Support for testing
	* Testing package
	* Go test command
	* _test.go suffix
	* Test file in same package
	* Excluded from regular builds
 * Strong, Statically typed language
   	* Primitive data types
	* Structs, slices, and maps
	* Type inference
 * Tools for Static Analysis
   	* Golint
	* Gofmt
	* Go vet
	* Compiler
* Safety
	* No pointer arithmetic
	* Automatic garbage collection
	* Reflect package to inspect values
	* Concurrency Model
 
Cons of Go:
* Lack of Generics
	* Less code reuse
	* Decreased productivity
	* Affects code maintainability
* Unusual Approach to Dependency Management
	* Source instead of artifact
* Implicit interfaces
	* Uses struct to implement interfaces
	* Difficulties understanding code
* Newer language issues
	* Smaller community
	* No web frameworks
	* Inconsistent library support
	* Integrations difficult
	* Uncommitted SDK providers
* GUI library
	* No native support
	* Requires time and effort
* No niche
	* Designed primarily to address google developers' task
	* No niche has materialized like some other languages
